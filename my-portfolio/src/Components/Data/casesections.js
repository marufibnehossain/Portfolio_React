    bgdetails:"Sam Bawden reached out to me one day with a crazy idea and asked me for some help. As an architect and craftsman, he was disappointed by the current options available for backcountry snowboarding. He knew that there had to be a better way and he set out to create just that. He envisioned snowboards that are lightweight, high performance, and designed for climbing just as much as they are for gliding back down. Sam reached out to me because he stumbled across a personal project of mine where and was inspired by the artwork. I had created about 25 animal drawings using flowing lines and shapes and he felt like I’d be a good fit to help create graphics on his boards.",

            details:"The board I was to design graphics for is called the Crane. Sam wanted the graphics it to symbolize the feeling of flow and motion, but with a nod to the high level of craftsmanship in the design of the board. With Sam’s background in architecture I saw just how much he valued details, parallel lines, and good proportions. I looked to architecture, birds, and linework for inspiration and put together a moodboard."
